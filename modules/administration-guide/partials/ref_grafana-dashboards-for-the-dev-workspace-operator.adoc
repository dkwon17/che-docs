= Grafana dashboards for the {devworkspace} operator

This section describes the example Grafana dashboard (see link:https://github.com/devfile/devworkspace-operator/blob/main/doc/grafana/grafana-dashboard.json[grafana-dashboard.json]) which displays metrics collected from the {devworkspace} operator.

The *{devworkspace}-specific metrics* panel contains information related to `DevWorkspace` startup.

Average workspace start time:: The average workspace start time.
Workspace starts:: The number successful and failed workspace starts.
Workspace startup duration:: Heatmap displaying workspace startup duration.
{devworkspace} successes / failures:: Comparison between successful and failed {devworkspace} startups
{devworkspace} failure rate:: The ratio between the number of failed workspace startups and the number of total workspace startups.
{devworkspace} startup failure reasons:: Pie chart displaying the distribution of workspace startup failures. The possible failure reasons are:
* `BadRequest`
* `InfrastructureFailure`
* `Unknown`
