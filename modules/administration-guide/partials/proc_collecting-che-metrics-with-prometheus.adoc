= Collecting {prod-short} metrics with Prometheus

This section describes how to use the Prometheus monitoring system to collect, store, and query metrics about {prod-short}.

.Prerequisites

* {prod-short} is exposing metrics on port `8087`. See xref:enabling-and-exposing-{prod-id-short}-metrics_{context}[Enabling and exposing {prod-short} server JVM metrics].

* Prometheus  2.26.0 or later is running. The Prometheus console is running on port `9090` with a corresponding *service* and *route*. See link:https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/[First steps with Prometheus].

.Procedure

* Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from the `8087` port:
+
.Prometheus configuration example
====
include::example$prometheus-config.adoc[]
====
+
<1> Rate, at which a target is scraped.
<2> Rate, at which recording and alerting rules are re-checked (not used in the system at the moment).
<3> Resources Prometheus monitors. In the default configuration, a single job called `che`, scrapes the time series data exposed by the {prod-short} server.
<4> Scrape metrics from the `8087` port.

.Verification steps

* Use the Prometheus console to query and view metrics.

+
View the metrics at `http://__<prometheus-url>__/metrics`.

+
Query metrics from `http://__<prometheus-url>__/graph`. For more information, see link:https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/#using-the-expression-browser[Using the expression browser].

* Verify that all targets are up by viewing the targets endpoint at `http://__<prometheus-url>__/targets`.
