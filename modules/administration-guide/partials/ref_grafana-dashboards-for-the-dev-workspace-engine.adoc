= Grafana dashboards for the {devworkspace} engine

This section describes the example Grafana dashboard (see link:https://github.com/devfile/devworkspace-operator/blob/main/doc/grafana/grafana-dashboard.json[grafana-dashboard.json]) which displays metrics collected from the {devworkspace} engine.

.The *DevWorkspace-specific metrics* panel

The *DevWorkspace-specific metrics* panel contains information related to `DevWorkspace` startup.

* *Average workspace start time* -- the average workspace start time
* *Workspace starts* -- the number successful and failed workspace starts 
* *Workspace startup duration* -- heatmap displaying workspace startup duration
* *DevWorkspace successes / failures* -- comparison between successful and failed DevWorkspace startups
* *DevWorkspace failure rate* -- the ratio between the number of failed workspace startups and the number of total workspace startups
* *DevWorkspace startup failure reasons* -- pie chart displaying the distribution of workspace startup failures. The possible failure reasons are:
    ** `BadRequest`
    ** `InfrastructureFailure`
    ** `WorkspaceEngineFailure`
    ** `Unknown`

.The *Operator metrics* panel, part 1

* *Webhooks in flight* -- comparison between the number of different webhook requests
* *Work queue duration* -- heatmap of how long reconcile requests stay in the work queue before being handled
* *Webhooks latency (/mutate)* -- heatmap displaying `/mutate` webhook latency
* *Reconcile time* -- heatmap displaying the reconcile duration

.The *Operator metrics* panel, part 2

* *Webhooks latency (/convert)* -- heatmap displaying `/convert` webhook latency
* *Work queue depth* -- the number of reconcile requests are in the work queue
* *Memory* -- memory usage for the {devworkspace} controller and the {devworkspace} webhook server
* *Reconcile counts (DWO)* -- average per-second number of reconcile counts for the {devworkspace} controller
