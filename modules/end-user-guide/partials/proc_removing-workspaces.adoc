= Removing workspaces

Removing a workspace only requires deleting the `DevWorkspace` custom resource.

TIP: Remove workspaces by using the {prod-short} dashboard whenever possible.

WARNING: Deleting the `DevWorkspace` custom resource will also delete other workspace resources if they were created by {prod-short} such as the referenced `DevWorkspaceTemplate` and per-workspace `PersistentVolumeClaims`.

.Procedure

* To remove a workspace, run the following command
[source,subs="+attributes"]
----
$ {orch-cli} delete devworkspace __<workspace_name>__ -n __<user_namespace>__
----
