= Removing workspaces

Removing a workspace only requires deleting the `DevWorkspace` custom resource.

Deleting the `DevWorkspace` custom resource will also delete other workspace resources if they were created by {prod-short} such as the referenced `DevWorkspaceTemplate` and per-workspace `PersistentVolumeClaims`.
