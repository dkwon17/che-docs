= Removing workspaces

You can remove a workspace by simply deleting the `DevWorkspace` custom resource.

WARNING: Deleting the `DevWorkspace` custom resource will also delete other workspace resources if they were created by {prod-short}: for example, the referenced `DevWorkspaceTemplate` and per-workspace `PersistentVolumeClaims`.

TIP: Remove workspaces by using the {prod-short} dashboard whenever possible.

.Procedure

. Get the `__<workspace_name>__` of the workspace to remove and the `__<user_namespace>__`.

* Run the following command to remove the workspace:
