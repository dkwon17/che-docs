Consider writing this entire page as a reference. (If so, then rename all the files in `/partials/` and in the `include::` statements below from `proc_` to `ref_`.)

On a {platforms-name} cluster, {prod-short} workspaces are represented as `DevWorkspace` custom resources of the same name.
As a result, if there is a workspace named `my-workspace` in the {prod-short} dashboard, there is a `DevWorkspace` named `my-workspace` in the user's {orch-namespace} on the {orch-name} cluster.

Since `DevWorkspaces` on the cluster represent {prod-short} workspaces, this allows managing {prod-short} workspaces using {orch-name} APIs with clients such as {orch-cli}.

Each `DevWorkspace` contains details derived from the workspace project's devfile, such as workspace container configurations and devfile commands.

Each `DevWorkspace` also references a `DevWorkspaceTemplate` custom resource using the `spec.contributions` field, which contains details about the editor for the workspace.

To manage a workspace with {orch-name} APIs, you must determine the workspace `NAME` and the `NAMESPACE` it is located in.
