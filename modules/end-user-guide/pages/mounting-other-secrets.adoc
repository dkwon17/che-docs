= Mounting other Secrets

You can automatically mount {orch-name} Secrets to all workspace containers, creating permanent mount points for components such as SSH key pairs or AWS authorization tokens.

Secrets are {orch-name} objects that store confidential data such as usernames, passwords, authentication tokens, and configurations in an encrypted form.

.Prerequisites

* A running instance of {prod-short}.
* You have GUI or CLI access to the {orch-name} cluster of your organization's {prod-short} instance.
* You have created a new Secret or determined an existing one in your user {orch-namespace} to mount to all workspaces containers.
* For CLI users: The `{orch-cli}` command line tool is installed in the operating system you are using.

.Procedure

. Determine an existing ConfigMap or Secret in your user {orch-namespace} to mount to all workspace containers.

. Set the required labels for mounting.

[TIP]
====
CLI users can run `{orch-cli}`: 

`$ {orch-cli} label secret __<Secret_name>__ controller.devfile.io/mount-to-devworkspace=true controller.devfile.io/watch-secret=true`
====

. Optional: Use the annotations to configure how the Secret is mounted.

.Optional annotations
|===
|Annotation | Description

|`controller.devfile.io/mount-path:`
| Specifies the mount path.

Defaults to `/etc/secret/__<Secret_name>__`.

|`controller.devfile.io/mount-as:`
| Specifies how the resource should be mounted: `file`, `subpath`, or `env`.

Defaults to `file`.

If `file`, mounts the keys and values as files within the mount path.

If `subpath`, mounts the keys and values as files within the mount path using subpath volume mounts.

If `env`, mounts the keys and values as environment variables in all containers in the {devworkspace}.
