= Mounting Volumes, Secrets and ConfigMaps

Users are able to mount their existing Persistent Volume Claims (PVC), Secrets and ConfigMaps into their {devworkspace} containers. 

The mounting process uses the standard {kubernetes} mounting mechanism. Mounting to the {devworkspace} containers requires additional labels and annotations applied to existing resources.

Resources are mounted when starting a new {devworkspace} or restarting an existing one.
