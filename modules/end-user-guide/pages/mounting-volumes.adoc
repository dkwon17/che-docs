= Mounting Volumes

You can mount a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) to your {devworkspace} containers. A PVC is used to request persistent storage resources which are abstracted from the user.

To automatically mount an existing PVC to all {devworkspace} containers:

.Prerequisites

* A running instance of {prod-short}.
* You have CLI or GUI access to the {orch-name} cluster of your organization's {prod-short} instance.
* For CLI users: The `{orch-cli}` command-line tool is installed in the operating system you are using.

.Procedure

. Determine an existing PVC in your user {orch-namespace} to mount to all {devworkspace} containers.

. Set the `controller.devfile.io/mount-to-devworkspace` label to `'true'`.

+
[TIP]
====
CLI users can apply the label like so:

`$ {orch-cli} -n __<user_{orch-namespace}>__ label persistentvolumeclaim __<PVC_name>__ controller.devfile.io/mount-to-devworkspace=true`
====

. Optional: Use the annotations to configure how the PVC is mounted.

|===
| Annotation |Description

| `controller.devfile.io/mount-path:`
| The mount path for the PVC. Defaults to `/tmp/__<PVC_name>__`.

| `controller.devfile.io/read-only:`
| Set to `'true'` or `'false'` to specify whether the PVC is to be mounted as read-only. Defaults to `'false'`, resulting in the PVC mounted as read-write.
