= Volumes, ConfigMaps, and Secrets

You can mount your xref:mounting-volumes.adoc[Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)], xref:mounting-configmaps.adoc[ConfigMaps], and xref:mounting-secrets.adoc[Secrets], such as a xref:git-credential-store.adoc[Git gredential store], into your {devworkspace} containers.

The mounting process uses the standard {kubernetes} mounting mechanism. Resources are mounted when starting a new {devworkspace} or restarting an existing one.

Mounting your existing resources to the {devworkspace} containers requires additional labels and annotations applied to your existing resources.
