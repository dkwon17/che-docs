= Injecting User Credentials and Configurations

== Mounting resources
You can inject your user credentials, configurations, and persistent volumes into your workspace containers.

This can be done by mounting xref:mounting-persistent-volumes.adoc[Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)], xref:mounting-configmaps.adoc[ConfigMaps], and xref:mounting-secrets.adoc[Secrets] into your workspace containers.

Permanent mount points can be created for components such as:

* Maven configuration, such as the `settings.xml` file 
* SSH key pairs
* AWS authorization tokens
* Configuration files
* Persistent storage
* Git credentials store files

The mounting process uses the standard {kubernetes} mounting mechanism, and requires additional labels and annotations applied to your existing resources. Resources are mounted when starting a new workspace or restarting an existing one.

== Image pull Secrets
You can configure image pull Secrets to be applied to workspace Pods to access container registries requiring authentication. See xref:image-pull-secrets.adoc[Creating image pull Secrets].
