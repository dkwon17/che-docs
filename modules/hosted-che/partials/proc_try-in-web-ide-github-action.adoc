= Using the Try in Web IDE GitHub action

The link:https://github.com/marketplace/actions/try-in-web-ide[Try in Web IDE GitHub action] can be added to a GitHub repository workflow to allow reviewers to quickly and test pull requests on Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat.
The action achieves this by listening to pull request events and automatically creating a comment and/or status check providing a link:https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/che-7/end-user-guide/creating-a-workspace-from-remote-devfile/#creating-a-workspace-from-the-default-branch-of-a-git-repository_che[factory URL].
This factory URL creates a new workspace (link:https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/che-7/end-user-guide/creating-a-workspace-from-remote-devfile/#creating-a-workspace-from-a-feature-branch-of-a-git-repository_che[from the pull request branch]) on Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat.

This section describes how to integrate the Try in Web IDE GitHub action to a GitHub repository workflow.

.Prerequisites

* A GitHub repository
* A devfile in the root of the GitHub repository (recommended)

.Procedure

. Create a `demo.yml` file in the `.github/workflows` directory in the GitHub repository with the following content:
+
include::example$snip_github-action-yaml-example.adoc[]

. Optionally configure the `add_comment` and `add_status` GitHub action inputs within `demo.yml`.

NOTE: Providing a link:https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/che-7/end-user-guide/authoring-devfiles-version-1/#what-is-a-devfile_che[devfile] in the root of the GitHub repository is highly recommended to define the development environment for the workspace created by the factory URL.
